00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,667
Okay so it's time to set up your computer and install the necessary software for this course.

2
00:00:01,998 --> 00:00:08,204
In this lesson I will show you how to install Python and configure your local environment so that way

3
00:00:08,264 --> 00:00:13,536
we don't have to rely on the trial environment on Jupiter dot org.

4
00:00:13,536 --> 00:00:18,296
I will show you how to install Python Anaconda on Mac OS.

5
00:00:18,296 --> 00:00:23,025
If you're running a Windows machine check out the other set of video instead.

6
00:00:23,196 --> 00:00:29,914
But before we begin let me explain what Python Anaconda is and why we're downloading it.

7
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,726
Anaconda is a python distribution.

8
00:00:32,956 --> 00:00:38,560
And this means that Anaconda aims to provide everything you need for data science in one place.

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:44,796
It's essentially a bundle of software and code that makes it easy for getting set up for Data Science

10
00:00:44,886 --> 00:00:46,533
and machine learning.

11
00:00:46,754 --> 00:00:52,327
For example the anaconda bundle already includes the Jupiter notebook so you don't have to separately

12
00:00:52,327 --> 00:00:59,296
download it and install it and it also includes tons and tons of Python packages and libraries that

13
00:00:59,296 --> 00:01:01,555
we'll be using in this course.

14
00:01:01,646 --> 00:01:03,604
What do I mean by libraries.

15
00:01:03,604 --> 00:01:12,209
Well remember how we wrote import pandas or import Mac plot lib or import I learn in our first project.

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:18,616
Usually you'd have to download all these packages one by one before you can use them in your project.

17
00:01:18,937 --> 00:01:25,384
But by downloading Anaconda we're going to be getting all these packages in one go that way we don't

18
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:27,844
have to worry about setup and configuration.

19
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:31,580
Later on in the course one word of warning though.

20
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,831
If you Google the word Anaconda you're probably not gonna get what you're looking for.

21
00:01:36,892 --> 00:01:44,333
You'll want to search Anaconda Python to find the Continuum dot Io Web site or alternatively click on

22
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:49,896
the link in the lessons resources to be directed directly to the download page.

23
00:01:49,906 --> 00:01:53,410
The thing about Python is it also comes in two flavors.

24
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,367
We're going to go with the newer version of Python.

25
00:01:57,588 --> 00:02:05,420
Python 3 so while anacondas downloading this is a good time to go for a coffee or tea after the download

26
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,794
completes you can start the installation.

27
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:14,126
We're going to be presented with one of those standards set up wizards so we're gonna click next.

28
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:19,217
Then when I agreed to the license agreement for probably signing away our first born child at this point.

29
00:02:19,288 --> 00:02:25,072
But on the next parts of the Wizard I'm just gonna go with the recommended options so I'm gonna seat

30
00:02:25,373 --> 00:02:26,729
install for just myself.

31
00:02:27,964 --> 00:02:34,059
And for the destination folder I'm also going to stick with the default power my computer actually isn't

32
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:39,240
as fast as it appears to be because I'm speeding up the video here but this installation process actually

33
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,596
takes a little while too.

34
00:02:40,757 --> 00:02:49,583
So just be patient and after the installer finishes I'm just gonna click close and move to trash and

35
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:50,126
that's it.

36
00:02:51,702 --> 00:02:58,360
Now it's time to fire up Anaconda and the Jupiter notebook just to see if everything's working click

37
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,802
on the little magnifying glass in the top right corner to bring up the spotlights search.

38
00:03:04,264 --> 00:03:11,916
Alternatively you can use the command space keyboard shortcut to bring up the same thing then type terminal

39
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:14,858
and hit enter.

40
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:18,152
Now your terminal might be styled a little differently from mine.

41
00:03:18,152 --> 00:03:23,454
I've made my text a little bigger and I've used the the black background so that's something you can

42
00:03:23,514 --> 00:03:29,549
set under the preferences so if it's the first time you're using terminal you probably have it set to

43
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:35,845
the basic theme instead of hombre which is what I've got but hopefully that will make it a little bit

44
00:03:35,845 --> 00:03:46,510
easier to read what I'm about to type and in this window type Python space dash dash version and here

45
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:53,478
you should see the version of Python that you've installed as well as the version of Anaconda and as

46
00:03:53,478 --> 00:03:54,714
we've mentioned before.

47
00:03:54,774 --> 00:04:01,331
Make sure the version of Python is three point six or higher next.

48
00:04:01,351 --> 00:04:05,820
Let me show you how to start up your own Jupiter notebook.

49
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,009
You can do that by simply typing.

50
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:08,591
Jupiter

51
00:04:12,206 --> 00:04:16,454
space notebook and hit enter.

52
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:17,809
Now give it a minute.

53
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,792
You should see Jupiter firing up in your browser.

54
00:04:20,882 --> 00:04:24,979
Showing you the folder structure in your home directory.

55
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:32,882
And when you click on new you should be able to start a new Python 3 notebook so congratulations on

56
00:04:32,882 --> 00:04:37,330
getting that working but starting up is only part of the equation.

57
00:04:37,371 --> 00:04:43,637
Also have to be able to shut this down properly and to shut down open notebook go to a file close and

58
00:04:43,637 --> 00:04:49,933
halt and you can log out and close your browser window.

59
00:04:49,983 --> 00:04:57,183
But the important part is terminating the Jupiter notebook from the terminal and you can do this with

60
00:04:57,183 --> 00:04:59,020
a keyboard shortcut.

61
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:06,009
You can see here in the instructions it says use control C to stop the server and shut down all kernels

62
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:15,137
twice to skip confirmation so on your keyboard press controls see twice you should then see the messages

63
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:21,223
shutting down kernels and that's how you close out of Jupiter completely.

64
00:05:21,223 --> 00:05:27,519
Finally let me show you all the components that were installed alongside with Anaconda and to do that.

65
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,361
Let me show you the anaconda Navigator.

66
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:34,688
So go to your launcher and find the anaconda navigator.

67
00:05:34,688 --> 00:05:41,637
Alternatively search for Anaconda navigator in your spotlight after it finishes loading.

68
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:44,841
You should see a window like this from here.

69
00:05:44,881 --> 00:05:51,840
We can launch the Jupiter notebook or the spider Python I.D. or even our studio.

70
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,291
All right.

71
00:05:52,322 --> 00:05:54,792
So congratulations on getting set up.

72
00:05:55,033 --> 00:06:01,329
If you have any problems or had any issues ask in the Q and A section for this lesson.

73
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:02,855
I'll see you in the next videos.
