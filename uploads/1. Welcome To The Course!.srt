Everyone, welcome to the web developer Bootcamp 2.0, the only course you need to learn web development,

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,270
at least according to my slides.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,550
Now, I know that claim sounds like something out of a late night infomercial, but this course does

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,050
have a long proven track record of helping people become developers.

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:21,690
That is very different, however, from claiming to teach every single topic language framework under

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,170
the sun.

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,970
That is not the goal of this course.
