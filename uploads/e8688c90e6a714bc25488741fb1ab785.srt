00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,889
Okay so it's time to set up your computer and install the necessary software for this course.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:12,418
In this lesson I will show you how to install Python and configure your local environment so that way

3
00:00:12,478 --> 00:00:17,743
we don't have to rely on the trial environment on Jupiter dot org.

4
00:00:17,743 --> 00:00:22,497
I will show you how to install Python Anaconda on Mac OS.

5
00:00:22,497 --> 00:00:27,221
If you're running a Windows machine check out the other set of video instead.

6
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:34,100
But before we begin let me explain what Python Anaconda is and why we're downloading it.

7
00:00:34,341 --> 00:00:36,908
Anaconda is a python distribution.

8
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:42,735
And this means that Anaconda aims to provide everything you need for data science in one place.

9
00:00:42,735 --> 00:00:48,963
It's essentially a bundle of software and code that makes it easy for getting set up for Data Science

10
00:00:49,053 --> 00:00:50,698
and machine learning.

11
00:00:50,919 --> 00:00:56,485
For example the anaconda bundle already includes the Jupiter notebook so you don't have to separately

12
00:00:56,485 --> 00:01:03,445
download it and install it and it also includes tons and tons of Python packages and libraries that

13
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:05,701
we'll be using in this course.

14
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:07,747
What do I mean by libraries.

15
00:01:07,747 --> 00:01:16,342
Well remember how we wrote import pandas or import Mac plot lib or import I learn in our first project.

16
00:01:16,593 --> 00:01:22,740
Usually you'd have to download all these packages one by one before you can use them in your project.

17
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:29,500
But by downloading Anaconda we're going to be getting all these packages in one go that way we don't

18
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,957
have to worry about setup and configuration.

19
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:35,687
Later on in the course one word of warning though.

20
00:01:35,758 --> 00:01:40,933
If you Google the word Anaconda you're probably not gonna get what you're looking for.

21
00:01:40,993 --> 00:01:48,424
You'll want to search Anaconda Python to find the Continuum dot Io Web site or alternatively click on

22
00:01:48,424 --> 00:01:53,980
the link in the lessons resources to be directed directly to the download page.

23
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,490
The thing about Python is it also comes in two flavors.

24
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,442
We're going to go with the newer version of Python.

25
00:02:01,662 --> 00:02:09,485
Python 3 so while anacondas downloading this is a good time to go for a coffee or tea after the download

26
00:02:09,485 --> 00:02:12,854
completes you can start the installation.

27
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:18,180
We're going to be presented with one of those standards set up wizards so we're gonna click next.

28
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:23,264
Then when I agreed to the license agreement for probably signing away our first born child at this point.

29
00:02:23,335 --> 00:02:29,111
But on the next parts of the Wizard I'm just gonna go with the recommended options so I'm gonna seat

30
00:02:29,412 --> 00:02:30,766
install for just myself.

31
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:38,087
And for the destination folder I'm also going to stick with the default power my computer actually isn't

32
00:02:38,087 --> 00:02:43,262
as fast as it appears to be because I'm speeding up the video here but this installation process actually

33
00:02:43,262 --> 00:02:44,616
takes a little while too.

34
00:02:44,776 --> 00:02:53,592
So just be patient and after the installer finishes I'm just gonna click close and move to trash and

35
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:54,133
that's it.

36
00:02:55,708 --> 00:03:02,357
Now it's time to fire up Anaconda and the Jupiter notebook just to see if everything's working click

37
00:03:02,357 --> 00:03:07,792
on the little magnifying glass in the top right corner to bring up the spotlights search.

38
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:15,896
Alternatively you can use the command space keyboard shortcut to bring up the same thing then type terminal

39
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,834
and hit enter.

40
00:03:18,995 --> 00:03:22,124
Now your terminal might be styled a little differently from mine.

41
00:03:22,124 --> 00:03:27,419
I've made my text a little bigger and I've used the the black background so that's something you can

42
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:33,506
set under the preferences so if it's the first time you're using terminal you probably have it set to

43
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:39,794
the basic theme instead of hombre which is what I've got but hopefully that will make it a little bit

44
00:03:39,794 --> 00:03:50,445
easier to read what I'm about to type and in this window type Python space dash dash version and here

45
00:03:50,445 --> 00:03:57,405
you should see the version of Python that you've installed as well as the version of Anaconda and as

46
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:58,639
we've mentioned before.

47
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:05,248
Make sure the version of Python is three point six or higher next.

48
00:04:05,268 --> 00:04:09,731
Let me show you how to start up your own Jupiter notebook.

49
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,917
You can do that by simply typing.

50
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:12,499
Jupiter

51
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:20,351
space notebook and hit enter.

52
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,705
Now give it a minute.

53
00:04:21,735 --> 00:04:24,684
You should see Jupiter firing up in your browser.

54
00:04:24,774 --> 00:04:28,866
Showing you the folder structure in your home directory.

55
00:04:29,046 --> 00:04:36,758
And when you click on new you should be able to start a new Python 3 notebook so congratulations on

56
00:04:36,758 --> 00:04:41,201
getting that working but starting up is only part of the equation.

57
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:47,499
Also have to be able to shut this down properly and to shut down open notebook go to a file close and

58
00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:53,787
halt and you can log out and close your browser window.

59
00:04:53,837 --> 00:05:01,028
But the important part is terminating the Jupiter notebook from the terminal and you can do this with

60
00:05:01,028 --> 00:05:02,863
a keyboard shortcut.

61
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:09,843
You can see here in the instructions it says use control C to stop the server and shut down all kernels

62
00:05:10,084 --> 00:05:18,960
twice to skip confirmation so on your keyboard press controls see twice you should then see the messages

63
00:05:19,321 --> 00:05:25,037
shutting down kernels and that's how you close out of Jupiter completely.

64
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:31,325
Finally let me show you all the components that were installed alongside with Anaconda and to do that.

65
00:05:31,536 --> 00:05:34,163
Let me show you the anaconda Navigator.

66
00:05:34,424 --> 00:05:38,486
So go to your launcher and find the anaconda navigator.

67
00:05:38,486 --> 00:05:45,426
Alternatively search for Anaconda navigator in your spotlight after it finishes loading.

68
00:05:45,476 --> 00:05:48,625
You should see a window like this from here.

69
00:05:48,665 --> 00:05:55,615
We can launch the Jupiter notebook or the spider Python I.D. or even our studio.

70
00:05:55,615 --> 00:05:56,066
All right.

71
00:05:56,097 --> 00:05:58,564
So congratulations on getting set up.

72
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:05,092
If you have any problems or had any issues ask in the Q and A section for this lesson.

73
00:06:05,092 --> 00:06:06,617
I'll see you in the next videos.
